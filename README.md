Urban Transportation Services (UTS), is a platform designed to manage and optimize transportation routes in Bogotá. It proposes real-time solutions: suggesting alternative routes during heavy traffic, sending alerts about road incidents, integrating Google APIs for precise location tracking, and fetching up-to-date weather data to inform users about current conditions.

The Users Microservice is a core component of the UTS ecosystem. Developed with Java and Spring Boot and backed by PostgreSQL, it follows the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring a clear separation between domain logic, application services, and infrastructure. It communicates with other services—such as Routes and E‑Invoicing—via API Gateway and REST APIs, enabling modular, scalable, and maintainable interaction.
